                <h3>Salesforce Data Migration</h3>
                <p>I migrated data from Sales cloud and Service cloud into a Public sector cloud. 
                    The organization wanted to have their data streamlined and associated in a single Salesforce Instance instead of having multiple instance which can lead to data inconsistency
                    The tools I used was Microsoft Excel and the Salesforce Inspector Reloaded</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Event Management System</h3>
                <p>This an event management system with lot of automation to enhance the workflow and reduce repetitive tasks. I used Apex,SOQL queries and Triggers to handle the automation
                    The event management now runs on full automation with little or no human interaction.
